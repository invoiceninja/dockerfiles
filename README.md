# Octane Docker for [Invoice Ninja](https://www.invoiceninja.com/)

:crown: **Features**

[FRANKENPHP](https://frankenphp.dev/)  
Built-in Chrome for PDF generation and other features  
Saxon XLST 2 engine  
OPcache  
Multi language support  

## Get started with Docker Compose

This Debian-based image includes Chrome for enhanced PDF generation and other features. To get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/invoiceninja/dockerfiles.git -b octane
cd dockerfiles/octane
```

Instead of defining our environment variables inside our docker-compose.yml file we now define this in the `.env` file, open this file up and insert your `APP_URL`, `APP_KEY` and update the rest of the variables as required.

```
APP_URL=http://in.localhost:8003/
APP_KEY=<insert your generated key in here>
APP_DEBUG=true
REQUIRE_HTTPS=false
IN_USER_EMAIL=
IN_PASSWORD=
```

## Initial account setup

### Primary account setup
Prior to starting the container for the first time, open the .env file and update the IN_USER_EMAIL and IN_PASSWORD variables with your primary account. 

This will take care of the initial account setup. You can later remove these .env variables.

> ⚠️ **Warning**  
> If `IN_USER_EMAIL` and `IN_PASSWORD` are not set the default user email and password is "admin@example.com" and "changeme!" respectively. 

After the container has completed the first startup you can delete these two environment variables.

### Generate a APP_KEY

The `APP_KEY` can be generated by running:

```bash
# If you haven't started the containers yet:
docker run --rm -it invoiceninja/invoiceninja-octane frankenphp php-cli artisan key:generate --show

# Or if your containers are already running:
docker compose exec app frankenphp php-cli artisan key:generate --show
```

Copy the entire string and insert in the .env file at `APP_KEY=base64....`

**Note: For PDF generation using localhost, your domain name MUST end in .test for PDFs to generate correctly due to Chrome's DNS resolver.

Start the container with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Note: When performing the setup, the Database host is ```mysql```

### Updating the Image

To upgrade to a newer release image, update your docker-compose.yml first by running:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

It is recommended to perform a backup before updating.
